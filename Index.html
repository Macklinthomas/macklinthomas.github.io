      First Project
    </h1>
    <p>
      During my senior year I was the user interface designer for our capstone project. Some of my classmates and I developed a website that would create unique passwords and store them. Once the user creates an account they have the option to store specific passwords for certain websites. Our password generator algorithm used alphabets, numbers, and special characters. The end goal was to be able to get permission for our site to auto populate the passwords in the websites that are stored in the users account. Before we could finish the semester ended and the team separated to their full-time jobs.

        Second Project
      </h1>
      <p>
        During my internship with MP2 Energy I designed a program that sends an email alert to the Demand Response team when there is a change in peak kilowatt hours on the electrical grid. The program runs in 15 minute increments once it is manually started at the beginning of the day. Using VBA, Sql, and some JavaScript I was able to retrieve the raw data and clean it and submit it into a program that checks the data and decides if an alert needs to be sent or not. The end goal for this project was to have the program running 24/7 but only checks between 6AM-4PM.
